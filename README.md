# Four_End_Point_App
The application can be executed by running the jar file in the command line.

In the command line, type "java -jar FourEndPointApp.jar" to run the application.

I choose Java and mySQL for this app, because these two are the most familiar and comfortable technologies for me to use. Also, Java and mySQL are widly used in many kinds of applications, they can be used in web application, desktop application as well as mobile applications.

There is a MANIFEST.MF file in the FourEndPointApp/META-INF folder(you can also get MANIFEST.MF by exract the .jar file), this file handles the versioning of this application.

The app is compiled and executed correctly on my machine, feel free to change the json file path and database name, url, username, and password in the source code.

For the Unit Test, I don't know how to implement this technology. I was trying to add junit to my project, but the result was incorrect. Sorry about that.
